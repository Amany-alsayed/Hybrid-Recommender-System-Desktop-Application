# Hybrid Recommender System Desktop Application

This desktop-based application delivers personalized movie recommendations by leveraging a hybrid recommender system. Built using Python and PyQt5, the system combines the strengths of multiple recommendation techniques‚Äîcontent-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization‚Äîto provide users with accurate and diverse movie suggestions in an interactive graphical interface.

The goal is to overcome the limitations of individual methods, such as the cold start problem, sparsity, and limited personalization, by blending them into a complementary hybrid model.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:

- PyQt5 for building a user-friendly graphical interface.

- NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning.

- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

- Surprise library for implementing collaborative filtering algorithms and matrix factorization models.

  
## üéØ Project Overview

A Python-based desktop application that combines PyQt5 for GUI with a hybrid recommender system integrating content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization. Designed for personalized movie recommendations through an interactive and user-friendly interface.


## üîÄ How the Hybrid Approach Works

Recommender systems are used in many real-world applications (e.g., Netflix, Spotify) to improve user satisfaction by suggesting the right content. Our system combines the following strategies:



### 1. Content-Based Filtering

- **Core Idea**: Recommends items based on features of items the user has previously liked.  
- **Features Used**: Genres, writers, directors, production countries, spoken languages, etc.  
- **Use Case**: Ideal for new users with little interaction history (cold start on the user side).



### 2. Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering relies on user-item interactions. It has two approaches:

#### üìå User-Based Collaborative Filtering

- **How it works**: Finds users with similar preferences and recommends items those users liked.  
- **Assumption**: "Users who liked the same items in the past will like similar items."

#### üìå Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

- **How it works**: Finds items similar to those the user has rated highly.  
- **Assumption**: "Users like items similar to ones they‚Äôve liked before."



### 3. Matrix Factorization (SVD - Singular Value Decomposition)

- **Core Idea**: Decomposes the user-item rating matrix into latent factors (features).

#### ‚úÖ Strengths:

- Handles large, sparse datasets efficiently.  
- Captures hidden patterns beyond surface-level similarities.

- **Why It Matters**: Used widely in industrial recommender systems, including Netflix's recommendation engine.



## ü§ù Why a Hybrid Approach?

Each individual method has limitations:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Can lead to over-specialization (narrow recommendations).  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Struggles with sparse datasets and new users/items.  
- **Matrix Factorization**: Needs a sufficient amount of data to train effectively.

### ‚úÖ By combining these methods:

- **Increased Diversity**: The hybrid model generates a wider variety of recommendations.  
- **Mitigated Weaknesses**: Combines strengths of each model to overcome issues like cold-start and overspecialization.  
- **Better Prediction Accuracy**: Works well for different user types, including both new and active users.

## ü§ñ Model Weights

Each model contributes **0.25** to the final prediction:

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Finds similarity based on user ratings.
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Finds similarity based on item ratings.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses metadata like genre, year, and description.
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**: Leverages matrix factorization for better recommendation.


## üåç Environment Preparation

To ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly, follow one of the methods below to set up your environment.

### Using Python Virtual Environment (venv)
